# How to install Tensorflow and keras for Deep Learning (the right method):
# STEPS:
# 1) First create a new Environment:
# 1.1) Go to Anaconda Navigator > Environments > Create
# 1.2) A dialog box will open after clicking 'create' named 'Create New Environment'
# 1.3) Enter the name of the environment : 'tensorflow_env' (u can give any name), select python and select python version (3.10.1) --> This is important
# Note : If you select a higher version you will see conflicts with dependencies (as stated on date 03-03-2024)
# 1.4) Click on the dropdown menu showing -> 'Installed' and select 'not installed'
# 1.5) Go to the search bar and type -> 'tensorflow' (select the package only showing the name --> 'tensorflow')
# Note: No need to install 'Keras'. Tensorflow comes with Keras. you can check that if you search 'Keras' in 'installed'.
# 2) Activate the 'tensorflow_env' :
# 2.1) Minimize the Anaconda Navigator
# 2.2) From the desktop windows search bar type 'Anaconda Powershell prompt'.
# 2.3) Open the prompt
# 2.4) type the command 'conda env list' to check all the existing Anaconda environments
# 2.5) To activate the new environement type 'conda activate tensorflow_env'
# Note: Now instead of 'base' (The currently active environemnt) you will see 'tensorflow_env'
# 3) Install ipykernel (if not already installed):
# 3.1) In the activated environment, install ipykernel using the following command 'conda install ipykernel'
# 4) Register the environment as a Jupyter kernel:
# 4.1) In the Anaconda Prompt, run the following command to register the environment as a Jupyter kernel:
#     python -m ipykernel install --user --name tensorflow_env --display-name "Python (tensorflow_env)"
# 4.2) Close the 'Anaconda Powershell Prompt' by using the command : 'Exit'
# 5) Install 'Jupyter notebook' in the 'tensorflow_env' from the 'Anaconda Navigator':
# 5.1) Open the minimized 'Anaconda Navigator' and go to 'Home'
# 5.2) Ensure that you see 'All applications on tensorflow_env channels'
# 5.3) Install 'Jupyter Notebook' from here. This will install the notebook in your new environment.
# 5.4) Lunch the 'Jupyter Notebook'
# 5.6) Open a new notebook and select the new kernel "Python (tensorflow_env)" to use. 
# 5.7) To import tensorflow use the command:
#     import tensorflow as tf 
# Note : For the first time importing might take some time. Wait for 2 mins. Have patience. 
# 5.8) To import keras use the command:
#     from tensorflow import keras 
#
# That's it. Hope this helps.
#
# Enjoy
